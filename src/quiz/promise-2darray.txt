Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

The asynchronous function sum2DArray defines a Promise object, 
resolving or rejecting based on input. If the input is not an array, 
it's rejected and handled by the catch block. For arrays, the sum is 
calculated asynchronously with a timeout, placing calculations in the event loop. 
After the main thread finishes, the error result is obtained, followed by the 
sum output. Adding a "then" block partially moves the operation off the main 
thread but not entirely onto the event loop.
